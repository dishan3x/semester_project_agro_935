Project Proposal

# Crop detection in real time using Microcomputer 


## Objective

Identify different crops in the ground by using a deep learning model via microcomputer


## Outcome

Video feed which differentiate and labeled in different crop category. 


## Rationale

Increase use technological equipment in a growing population has had a greater impact in human life style. Equipment’s such as computers, phones, robots etc.   has been immense help in increasing quality of life. Artificial intelligence is a computer system which has the capability in performing task that are ordinary require human intelligent.  In this project ill be utilizing deep learning which is a sub part in Artificial intelligence, for the most part is creating or training models by analyzing substantial visual imagery. I will be analyzing real time data which take input as a visual imagery through a camera and analyzing them using a deep learning model. I’ll be using a raspberry pi as the Microcomputer and a raspberry pi camera. There will be an analysis on GPU utilization field by raspberry and atom pi.

## Process Planned

- Identifying the robust changes in the scene in motion
- Detect each object in different view point (etc. Different shapes and sizes of the same object)
